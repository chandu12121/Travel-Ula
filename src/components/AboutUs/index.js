        <h2 className="sub-title">Our Journey</h2>
        <div className="timeline">
          <p>
            <strong>2014 - </strong>Founded by K. Chandrashekar, our journey began in a cozy café in Bangalore, where a passion for nature and adventure sparked the creation of our proprietary firm. We initially catered to 100 nature enthusiasts, designing customized itineraries that took them to some of the most stunning parks in India and Africa. This humble beginning ignited a vision to connect travelers with the wonders of the natural world, setting the stage for the transformative experiences we offer today.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2015-2016 - </strong>Thanks to the enthusiastic word-of-mouth referrals from our guests, we evolved from a small venture into a Private Limited company, now proudly serving over 1,000 plus travellers and their families. Our expansive offerings include leisure and wilderness holidays across India, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, allowing us to create unforgettable experiences for adventurers of all kinds.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2017-2018 - </strong>We expanded our reach to manage large corporate events in offbeat destinations, successfully catering to corporate groups ranging from 100 to 150 attendees per event. Our team grew from just 4 to 10 dedicated professionals, allowing us to enhance our offerings for families seeking leisure holidays around the globe. Alongside this growth, we remained committed to serving nature enthusiasts and wildlife photographers, crafting customized, bespoke journeys that immerse them in the beauty of the wild.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2018-2020 - </strong>We successfully organized large corporate events in offbeat destinations, accommodating groups ranging from 150 to 400 participants. Our wildlife journeys to Africa have seen remarkable growth, starting with just 19 guests and reaching an impressive 125 during the wildebeest migration season alone. Each year, we proudly serve over 500 guests exploring nature parks across India and beyond. Our leisure holiday offerings have also expanded significantly, establishing us as one of the top travel consultants for Kerala and Himachal tourism. With our experienced team now enthusiastically catering to destinations like the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Bali, and the Andaman Islands, we continue to create unforgettable experiences for travelers around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2020-2021 - </strong>During the challenging times of the pandemic, we united to support our community. As pioneers, we launched a web series featuring renowned wildlife photographers and media personalities, sharing their insights with our guests. All proceeds from these events were donated to forest guards and their families in need, exemplifying our commitment to those who protect our natural world.
          </p>
          <p>We also conducted a very successful Wildlife photography competition called 'RIGHT XPOSURE' with International judges. We had Discovery channel and Sanctuary Asia as our lead sponsors and mentors.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>2023-2024 - </strong>In the aftermath of the pandemic, while many travel companies faced closure, we emerged stronger than ever. Although some of our team members returned to their hometowns, we renewed our commitment to excellence and quickly adapted to the changing landscape. 2024 has been one of our most successful years, particularly in our Africa business, as our leisure travel offerings have rebounded impressively. With our delighted customers returning and operations back on track, we are excited about the future and ready to create even more unforgettable experiences.
